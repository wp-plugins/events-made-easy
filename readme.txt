Manage and display events, recurring events, locations and maps, widgets, RSVP, ICAL and RSS feeds, payment gateways support. SEO compatible.
             
== Description ==
Events Made Easy is a full-featured event management solution for Wordpress. Events Made Easy supports public, private, draft and recurring events, locations management, RSVP (+ optional approval), Paypal, 2Checkout, Google Checkout and Google maps. With Events Made Easy you can plan and publish your event, or let people reserve spaces for your weekly meetings. You can add events list, calendars and description to your blog using multiple sidebar widgets or shortcodes; if you are a web designer you can simply employ the template tags provided by Events Made Easy. 

Events Made Easy integrates with Google Maps; thanks to geocoding, Events Made Easy can find the location of your event and accordingly display a map. 
Events Made Easy handles RSVP and bookings, integrates payments for events using paypal and other payment gateways and allows payment tracking.

Events Made Easy provides also a RSS and ICAL feed, to keep your subscribers updated about the events you're organising. 

Events Made Easy is fully multi-site compatible.

Events Made Easy is fully customisable; you can customise the amount of data displayed and their format in events lists, locations, attendees and in the RSS/ICAL feed. Also the RSVP form can be changed to your liking with extra fields, and by using EME templates let you change the layout even per page!

Events Made Easy is fully localisable and already partially localised in Italian, Spanish, German, Swedish, French and Dutch. 

Events Made Easy is also fully compatible with qtranslate (and mqtranslate): most of the settings allow for language tags so you can show your events in different languages to different people. The booking mails also take the choosen language into account.

For more information visit the [Documentation Page](http://www.e-dynamics.be/wordpress/) and [Support Forum](http://www.e-dynamics.be/bbpress/). 

== Installation ==

Always take a backup of your db before doing the upgrade, just in case ...  
1. Upload the `events-made-easy` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory  
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress  
3. Add events list or calendars following the instructions in the Usage section.  

== Upgrade from the older Events Manager Extended plugin ==

Events Made Easy is completely backwards compatible with the old data from Events Manager Extended. Just deactivate the old plugin, remove the files if you want, and proceed with the Events Made Easy installation as usual. Events Made Easy takes care of your events database migration automatically. 

== Usage == 

After the installation, Events Made Easy add a top level "Events" menu to your Wordpress Administration.

*  The *Events* page lets you edit or delete the events. The *Add new* page lets you insert a new event.  
	In the event edit page you can specify the number of spaces available for your event. You just need to turn on RSVP for the event and specify the spaces available in the right sidebar box.  
	When a visitor responds to your events, the box sill show you his reservation. You can remove reservation by clicking on the *x* button or view the respondents data in a printable page.
	You can also specify the category the event is in, if you activated the Categories support in the Settings page.  
	Also fine grained control of the RSVP mails and the event layout are possible here, if the defaults you configured in the Settings page are not ok for this specific event.  
*  The *Locations* page lets you add, delete and edit locations directly. Locations are automatically added with events if not present, but this interface lets you customise your locations data and add a picture. 
*  The *Categories* page lets you add, delete and edit categories (if Categories are activated in the Settings page). 
*  The *People* page serves as a gathering point for the information about the people who reserved a space in your events. 
*  The *Pending approvals* page is used to manage registrations/bookings for events that require approval 
*  The *Change registration* page is used to change bookings for events 
*  The *Settings* page allows a fine-grained control over the plugin. Here you can set the [format](#formatting-events) of events in the Events page.
*  Access control is in place for managing events and such: 
        - a user with role "Editor" can do anything 
        - with role "Author" you can only add events or edit existing events for which you are the author or the contact person 
        - with role "Contributor" you can only add events *in draft* or edit existing events for which you are the author or the contact person 

Events list and calendars can be added to your blogs through widgets, shortcodes and template tags. See the full documentation at the [Events Made Easy Support Page](http://www.e-dynamics.be/wordpress/).

== Changelog ==

= 1.5.9
* Bugfix: the unique nbr for bookings only got generated when online payment was being selected too, now it gets generated if the total booking price >0

= 1.5.8 =
* Feature: added 2 new scopes: relative-Xd--YYYY-MM-DD (end YYYY-MM-DD, start X days before that) and YYYY-MM-DD--relative+Xd (start YYYY-MM-DD, end X days past that)
* Feature: added monthly range select in filter form: use #_FILTER_MONTHRANGE in the filter format and fields=monthrange in the eme_filterform shortcode
* Feature: the shortcode eme_add_multibooking_form now also supports category_id as a parameter, to select all events for a single category
* Doc: documented the template_id option for the shortcode eme_filterform, as the template is preferred before the fields option
* Bugfix: first day of week in the datepicker is a integer, not a string. Putting a string created mangled day headers in the datepicker.

= 1.5.7 =
* Feature: first day of week is now also respected in the datepicker

= 1.5.6 =
* Feature: added 2 new filters to influence CSV output: eme_csv_header_filter and eme_csv_footer_filter

  Can be used to add extra info at the top or bottom of the CSV output
* Feature: new event placeholder #_RECURRENCE_NBR, returns the sequence number of an event in a recurrence series (first event is 1, second is 2, etc ...)
  Also added conditional tags #_IS_FIRST_RECURRENCE and #_IS_LAST_RECURRENCE

* Bugfix: small html correction in EME admin interface, tab Payments
* Bugfix: fix some 'notcategory' behaviour for the eme_events shortcode
* Bugfix: the optional choosen template got lost when switching months in the full calendar

* Bugfix: make rsvp form work again (copy/paste error fix)

* Feature: added placeholder #_BOOKINGID for rsvp mails and booking info, in case you want to share the booking id
* Feature: added new filter eme_add_currencies, so you can add extra currencies to the list. Be aware that not all payment portals support all currencies.

* Feature: format templates can now be created and used in the events_list and events_locations shortcodes as follows:

* Feature: added a facebook import function when creating a new event. Thanks to Tom Chubb and Jashwant Singh Chaudhary.
